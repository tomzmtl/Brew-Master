# Brewing

The game completely revolves around the awesome art of brewing beer.

## Brewing process

* Buy brewing ingredients.
* Feed ingredients into your production facility.
* Start brewing process and wait.
* Sell your beer.
* ...profit!

### Beer batches

Once you start the brewing process, all the ingredients you placed in your equipment will produce one beer batch.
It's an arbitrary unit that represents several bottles/kegs. The batch/bottle ratio is irrelevant to know.

### Beer properties

The beer you produce has multiple properties:

* Type
* Color
* Strength
* IBU

Each batch you produce will have these properties set depending on the ingredients and process you used to brew your beer.
Trying different combinations of ingredients will produce different types of beers.

[TBD] For future releases, even more can be added, like opacity, thickness, aromas etc..

## Ingredients

Ingredients and their properties are the deciding factor of a batch's properties.

### Grain

Grain is the base ingredient that produces the initial wort.
It is the key for deciding the type, color and strength of the beer.

Grain has several properties of its own:

#### Variety

The main variety of grain. Can be either barley or wheat. Decides the beer type.

#### Roast level

Key factor to decide the final color of the beer.

#### Sugar level

Key factor to decide the final strength of the beer.

### Hops

Hops are the key ingredient to decide the final IBU level (bitterness) of the beer.
It also plays a big role in the general flavor.

### Yeast

Yeast turns the wort into beer by converting sugar into alcohol.
Different types of yeast yield different types of beer.

## The production facility

### Overview

The facility contains all the equipment necessary to brew your beer, from Mashing equipment to storage.

You will start the game with a minimal equipment set, but you will be able to upgrade it with time (and money).
Doing so will provide you with more variables to give you access to more varieties of beers to brew.
It could also provide extra perks, like increasing the quantity you can produce by batch.

### Facility equipments

Each of these represents a step in the process, the end resulting in a batch.
Equipment can be customized to add additional ingredients or properties to the resulting batch.
