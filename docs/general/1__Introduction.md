# Brew Master, a game about brewing beer!

## Introduction

Brew Master is a game about managing a micro brewery.
The main goal is to setup the ultimate brewing installation, winning awards and getting rich by brewing a large variety of beers!
The game will contain some rogue-inspired elements, like randomized marketplace, perks or events.

Brewing beer is a complex task, and probably requires a lifetime to master.
Brew Master will feature a simplified, streamlined version of this process to leave some place to fun.
That said, we will try to stay genuine to the art of brewing, as long as we can keep the gameplay simple.
