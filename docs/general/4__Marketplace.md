# Marketplace

The market place is the interface from which you can buy ingredients and upgrade your facility.
It is basically a list of items from which you can consult properties and price and decide

The marketplace will feature a randomised selection of items that will change over time.
Each item has an expiration time at which the item will be removed and a new one will take its place.

When the player buys one or more items, these will be removed from the marketplace and placed in the player's inventory.
